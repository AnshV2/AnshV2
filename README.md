  <h2> About Me: </h2>
  <p>
- 💻 I have been learning (and improving!) my machine learning and Data Science. You can find my kaggle where I do most of my stuff at the bottom! 
    <br>
- 🔎 I've also been learning and refining my front end skills with react. My aesthetic skills are improving slowly rest assured. 
        <br>
- 🎵 I am a music enthusiast! my spotify is AnshV2 feel free to check out my playlists as disorganized as they are.
        <br>
- 🎥 I'm also quite the media consumer from tv.shows to anime and movies. Hyped for the new anime season (current favorite: Blue Lock)!</b></u></a>
